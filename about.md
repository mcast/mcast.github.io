## Other abodes

In no particular order,

* [my old website](http://www.t8o.org/~mca1001)
* <https://gitlab.com/mcast>
* <https://github.com/mcast>, formerly known as ~~<https://github.com/mca-wtsi>~~
* <http://sourceforge.net/users/mca1001>, formerly known as <http://sourceforge.net/u/mca-gdl/profile/>
* <https://metacpan.org/author/MCAST> == <http://search.cpan.org/~mcast/>
* <https://launchpad.net/~mcra>

I suspect naming one's online selves after one's employer is an anti-pattern, and should be some kind of warning to that self.

## Namespace neighbours

These are not me, I merely noticed they share a name or handle similar to mine.  Hi, neighbours!

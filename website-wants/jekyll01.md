# {{page.title}}

Things I added already

* [index](/index.html) aka. home or top page
* [about](/about.html)
* human readable [sitemap](/sitemap.html)
* custom [404](/404.html)
* README.md
	* For the [Github repo view](https://github.com/mcast/mcast.github.io#readme)
	* Also appearing in the [published view](/README.html), unless you mark it unpublished
* Policy on [URL changes](http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html).

though some of these start with a "work in progress" mark.

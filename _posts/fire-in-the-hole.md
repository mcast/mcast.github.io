(I need to mash up a picture of toad-in-the-hole-with-chili-peppers).

This is my "artists impression" of Toad in the Hole made with hot chili peppers.  I will not be making this.

[*Toad in the Hole] Sausages roasted into a batter.

It's the sort of dish I imagine would be eaten with a Spoonerism at a restaurant called The Gurning Bullet.

[*Spoonerism] A play on words in which initial sweaters are lopped (letters are swapped) for humorous effect.

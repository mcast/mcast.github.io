Screenshot of PowerTOP telling me that Firefox is using 1.36 kilowatts, from 2016-04-26.

Of course I don't believe it for a moment, and I didn't bother to find out why it reported such a large value.  It's probably just a miscalibration or instantaneous sampling error.

I did like the way the units library knows what a kilowatt is, despite being in some software that's unlikely to ever see one.

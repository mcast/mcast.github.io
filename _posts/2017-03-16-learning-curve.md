I find myself [writing](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/horizon-to-nova-hinting) "The underlying idea is that the platform pushes you up the learning curve in an optimal direction" and this seems to warrant more explanation.

On a large platform such as [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), it is not so much a learning curve as a fractal landscape for exploration.  There are some sensible and well-documented routes where most people will travel.  You have a starting point, and hopefully a "You Are Here" indicator.  You have a destination, or hopefully at least an idea of your initial direction.

Traditional approaches to documentation include

* describing the Golden Path
* answering Frequently Asked Questions or showing solutions to recurring problems
* answering imagined or expected questions that putative users might raise later
* training courses
* tip of the day

The learning curve is often presented as a monotonic ascending curve, often with increasing gradient, like `y = x*x` but who says it has to be a one-dimensional uphill struggle?

I find the learning landscape is more fun, and I make better progress across it, when

* I'm wearing skis of a suitable length to prevent falling down fractal rabbit holes
* there is a convenient ski lift to take me up somewhere interesting
* it's downhill all the way

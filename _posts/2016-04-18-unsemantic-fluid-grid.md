After considering calling this site "The Blog With No Style", and rejecting that idea because it did have some CSS in the `<head>`, I concluded that [the Unsemantic fluid grid](http://unsemantic.com/demo-responsive) would be a good improvement ({% include blogsrc.html ci='46f5f170f72e4c0abc86ae73eae8d9a878801177' %}).

Now it has a shape, without overlapping `<div>` ugliness, and something like mobile-responsive layout.  Thanks Nathan!

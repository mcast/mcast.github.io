After considering calling this site "The Blog With No Style", and rejecting that idea because it did have some CSS in the `<head>`, I concluded that [the Unsemantic fluid grid](http://unsemantic.com/demo-responsive) would be a good improvement ({% include blogsrc.html ci='bfa93d3a24626ff1e575047735e23bda7c315083' %}).

Now it has a shape, without overlapping `<div>` ugliness, and something like mobile-responsive layout.  Thanks Nathan!

This is something I try to remember when reporting problems and asking for change.  As it happens, it is a story of two people named John with a decade in between - thanks John!

## Don't do that

Many years ago, someone told me "don't do *that*", whatever that was.  I was left wondering what I should be doing instead, and also somewhat miffed that he had made no effort to help.

## Do this instead

At this point I concluded that "please do this instead" is far more helpful.  It can come in various flavours.

* reasons why "don't do that" is important.  What's going to break if you go against the advice?
* a list of possible alternatives and some suggestions for how to choose among them.
* or an apology for not offering alternatives.  "Sorry I couldn't think of a better way to do it" at least shows that I understand what's missing.

## How it can help generate new ideas

After saying "don't", I remember I want to say "but do".  I find I can't, so I say sorry.

Now I'm thinking about solutions, and an idea pops into my head from nowhere!  Here's a bit out of the bottom of the email where it happened

This [repository](https://github.com/mcast/mcast.github.io)
holds my [blog and related web pages](http://mcra.t8o.org/).

## Upstream Rebase Alert

Git history will be revised, rebased or otherwise force-pushed when I
feel like it.  If you're branching for some reason ðŸ˜•, <!-- emoji here -->
talk first.

## Copying

You may freely copy certain "small" types of data

* snippets of blog engine configuration
* pieces of code from blog articles
* test data or sample inputs

I would appreciate attribution via hyperlink, but I think such
creations are too small to justify the attention of a big complicated
thing like copyright law.

You may for the purposes of conversation quote chunks of my opinions
or statements from this site, if you mark it up as such.  Please let
me know if you suspect I might want to reply.

Larger works and other repositories should have their own copyright
statements on them.

You will have other rights of copying that I haven't bothered to
outline here.

If it isn't clear what I intended, please contact me before using the
material.
